This is the website for @myntra clone , so here this website contains all features and characterstics same as myntra website but the only thing is i did not used javascript or anyframeworks for this website as i am still in alearning phase
so i have used my all knowledge based on the css and html and no interactivity feature but will just look at the webpage creation using the html and css 
This website includes all the properties of html and css
html is used for structure and css is used for styling like an example of car : car outer surface or structure like where should be the tire,glass,engine all these are comes under the html
when it comes to css : the color of the car,inside color and style of the car , all are comes under the css only
javascript : i did not used js here but let me tell u js stands for interactivity of the webpage suppose if u click a page or u want to make it like going to the server and dowmloading the files and sources and returning back to the client side all that is done by js and frameworks.
THANKYOU.
